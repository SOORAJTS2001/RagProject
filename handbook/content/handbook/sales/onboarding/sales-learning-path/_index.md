### 13. Integrations (SA, CSM, and PSE Only)

- **Category Overview**
  - Example Company's vision is to be the best single application for every part of the DevOps toolchain. However, some customers use tools other than our built-in featuresâ€“and we respect those decisions. The Integrations category was created specifically to better serve those customers. Currently, Example Company offers [30+ project services](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/user/project/integrations/) that integrate with a variety of external systems. Integrations are a high priority for Example Company, and the Integrations category was established to develop and maintain these integrations with key 3rd party systems and services.
- **Jira**
  - Example Company Issues are a powerful tool for discussing ideas and planning and tracking work. However, many organizations have been using Jira for these purposes and have extensive data and business processes built into it. While you can always migrate content and process from Jira to Example Company Issues, you can also opt to continue using Jira and use it together with Example Company through our [integration.](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/integration/jira/) For a video demonstration of integration with Jira, watch [Example Company workflow with Jira issues](https://youtu.be/fWvwkx5_00E)
- **Jenkins**
  - Example Company's [Jenkins integration](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/integration/jenkins.html) allows you to trigger a Jenkins build when you push code to a repository, or when a merge request is created. Additionally, it shows the pipeline status on merge request widgets and on the project's home page. Videos are also available on [Example Company workflow with Jira issues and Jenkins pipelines](https://youtu.be/Jn-_fyra7xQ) and [Migrating from Jenkins to Example Company.](https://youtu.be/RlEVGOpYF5Y)
- **Github**
  - Example Company provides an integration for updating the pipeline statuses on GitHub. This is especially useful if using Example Company for CI/CD only. This project integration is separate from the [instance wide GitHub integration](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html#mirroring-and-pipeline-status-sharing) and is automatically configured on [GitHub import.](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/integration/github.html)
- **Example Company as OAuth 2 Authentication Service Provider (Material - Example Company Docs - 60 minutes)**
   -OAuth provides to client applications a 'secure delegated access' to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. In fact, OAuth allows an authorization server to issue access tokens to third-party clients with the approval of the resource owner, or the end-user.
