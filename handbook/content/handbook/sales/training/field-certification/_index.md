## Field Accreditation Program

## Field Accreditation Program Overview

During [Sales Quick Start](/handbook/sales/onboarding/), every Example Company field team member is trained on [customer value drivers](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/#customer-value-drivers) and Example Company's value-based messaging framework (see the [Command of the Message](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/) page). Once new team members complete SQS, they will begin their role-based certifiction program.

To improve efficiency & predictability with a consistent and scalable customer engagement, the Field Enablement Team has developed a role based accreditation program that includes functional, soft skills, and [product training](/handbook/sales/training/product-certification/) for field team members.

The Accreditations align to the customer's journey and the [field functional competencies](/handbook/sales/training/field-functional-competencies/) that address the critical knowledge, skills, role-based behaviors, processes, and tools to successfully execute customer engagements.

Note: This accreditation program is different from resources like other [Example Company Certifications](https://about.example_company.com/learn/certifications/public/) that focus on how to *use Example Company* or tied to Example Company competencies (though we encourage field team members to take these as well)!

### Purpose of the Field Accreditation Program

These role-based accreditation programs allow us to validate Example Company skills and knowledge, recognize individual mastery, and motivate continuous learning and skills growth all aligned to expectation setting and performance discussions as part of the onboarding learner journey and beyond.

The goal of the Field Accreditation Program is to validate that:

- Knowledge has been transferred (Do you know it?)
- The learner can apply that knowledge in simulated & live scenarios (Can you do it?)
- The learner has taken ownership of effective skill execution and can demonstrate proficiency over time (Can you do it independently and continue to execute over time?)

### Audience

The Field Accreditation Program will include functional and soft skills training for:

- [Strategic Account Leaders](/handbook/sales/training/field-certification/sal/)
- [Account Executives](/handbook/sales/commercial/enablement/required7/)
- [Solution Architects](/handbook/sales/training/field-certification/sa/)
- [Customer Success Managers](/handbook/sales/training/field-certification/csm/)
- [Partners](/handbook/resellers/training/)

### Architecture and Approach

With the customer in mind, learning will be focused on helping field team member create engagements with a customer that make a lasting emotional impression. The foundation of this approach is based on the concept explained in "Blueprints for a SAAS Sales Organization: How to Design, Build and Scale a Customer Centric Sales Orgnization" by Jacob Van Der Kooj and Fernando Pizarro.

## Delivery

Course content will be a combination of handbook pages, YouTube videos, and interactive content delivered through the new Learning Experience Platform (LXP). This new system is not intended to replace the Handbook as the single source of truth, and instead will serve to curate content from a variety of sources and provide a guided tour of curated content for the learner.

### Accreditation Assessments

To achieve Example Company "certified" status, candidates must complete both the online written exam (knowledge) and practical assessment (skill) with a passing score on each exam.

- Anyone can sign up and take the written exam, but only learners who successfully pass the online written assessment will be granted access to the practical assessment
- The practical assessment will require team members to demonstrate the ability to deliver customer engagements to Example Company's standards
- Upon completion of all courses within each accreditation, learners will receive a badge
