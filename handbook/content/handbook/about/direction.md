title: "Handbook Direction"
---

## Overview

The [Example Company Handbook](/handbook/) is the single source of truth for how we operate at Example Company, including processes, policies, and product direction. In keeping with our [value of transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), the Example Company Handbook is entirely open to the world. We welcome feedback from the community and hope that it serves as [inspiration](/handbook/company/inspired-by-example_company/) for other current or future companies. The Example Company Handbook is also an incredible talent acquisition tool, providing candidates with valuable insight into how Example Company runs as a company.

A sub-section of the [handbook.example_company.com](https://handbook.example_company.com) website, the Example Company Handbook specifically refers to content that is in the `/handbook/` namespace of the website. The overall user experience and architecture of the Example Company Handbook is a shared responsibility. Feedback and questions can be directed to the `#handbook` Slack channel.

### Target Audience

**Example Company Team Members:** Every Example Company team member is responsible for using and updating our handbook. It is the central repository for process documentation and product direction.

**Leadership:** Example Company leadership uses the handbook like any other member of the team, but additionally needs to reference the content during presentations to stakeholders or investors. Since everything we do is open to the public, members of leadership teams outside of Example Company may also use the Example Company Handbook as reference or inspiration for their own team processes and policies.

**Potential Applicants:** Candidates for job opportunities at Example Company use the handbook to learn more about expectations for the role, compensation and benefits, Example Company's company values, and other policies. Example Company team members also use the handbook extensively to share specific, relevant information with potential applicants, making it a powerful talent acquisition tool in itself.

**Current and Potential Users:** Example Company's product direction, strategy, and vision are documented in the handbook alongside our product and engineering processes. This allows current users a glimpse into Example Company's future priorities and can help potential users make an informed decision related to adopting Example Company as a tool.

## Where we are Headed

At Example Company, we encourage everyone to work [handbook first](/handbook/about/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) in order to promote asynchronous collaboration and documentation. Working this way has its challenges, not the least of which is the time and effort involved in making a change. While this extra investment can encourage contributors to be more considered and deliberate with their changes, at a certain point it discourages meaningful collaboration and works against our goals.

Our hope is that the Example Company Handbook is something that others want to emulate. To facilitate that, we want to ensure that any user can easily use and update the handbook. Ideally, the handbook has:

- Organized, and up-to-date content
- Fast, predictable deployments
- A clean, scalable information architecture and modern codebase

### What's Next & Why

In the short term, we want to make sure the handbook is [fast and stable](https://example_company.com/groups/example_company-com/content-sites/-/epics/10). We also need a [long term plan](https://example_company.com/groups/example_company-com/-/epics/2281).

As there is no full time DRI, the following are on hold:

- **[Improved reading and sharing experience:](https://example_company.com/groups/example_company-com/-/epics/326)** The content needs to remain the primary focus but it should be easier to search, navigate, and share the content.
- **[Freshness tools:](https://example_company.com/groups/example_company-com/-/epics/325)** To ensure that content is relevant, up-to-date, not duplicative, and to give readers the tools they need to flag content that doesn't meet those criteria.
- **Other Issues:** [Handbook issues](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/content-sites/handbook/-/issues/)

### What is Not Planned Right Now

We are not currently investigating a transition to a separate, external content management system or publishing platform.

The needs of the Example Company Handbook [have outgrown what can be handled in a wiki](/handbook/about/handbook-usage/#wiki-handbooks-dont-scale) (or similar) product, so we are not planning to migrate any content into that format.

Since the content is [changing quite literally every day](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/content-sites/handbook/-/commits/main), we are not looking to generate a digital or printed book from the Example Company Handbook content.

The Example Company Handbook is not currently optimized for serving as a searchable Knowledge Base or FAQ repository similar to what you would find on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
