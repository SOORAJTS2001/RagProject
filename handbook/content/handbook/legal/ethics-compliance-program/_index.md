## Mission

Example Company Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries,***"Example Company"***, ***"we"***, ***"our"***) is committed to lawful and ethical behavior in all we do and expects members of Example Company's Board of Directors (***"Board"***) and officers, employees, and contractors (collectively, ***"Team Members"***) to conduct business ethically, with integrity, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Example Company's culture is based on our [VALUES](/handbook/values/), which are reflected in and reinforced by our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and various supporting policies, such as our Anti-Fraud Policy and Anti-Retaliation Policy (collectively, ***"Compliance Standards"***). Because Example Company is made up of individuals who are aligned with our VALUES and who are accountable to our customers, shareholders, and each other, we have designed this Ethics and Compliance Program (the ***"Program"***) as an operational framework for our team members. This Program is dedicated to (among other things) making sure Example Company's Compliance Standards are current, complete, and readily accessible. Team Members are educated on these Compliance Standards, through continuous training, awareness campaigns, required annual reviews and acknowledgments, and additional resources, including #compliance-legal.

While compliance is certainly a company-wide effort, it is as importantly the individual responsibility of each and every Example Company team member. By embracing our Compliance Standards, together we will maintain our good standing and instill our customers and the wider community with confidence when they place their trust in Example Company.

### Policy Change Management

We anticipate the need for policy amendments and new policies and procedures, as Example Company continues to respond to the ever-evolving laws and regulations that our policies are designed to address. Team members who wish to implement new policies and/or amendments to policies identified [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p5_02x6nBy1ftLYwhzTvm1lk47ijVdhlGVEJvU7M4xI/edit?usp=sharing) must document all necessary approvals (including DRI and Board, when necessary) using this [issue template](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/legal-and-compliance/-/blob/master/.example_company/issue_templates/policy-requests.md?ref_type=heads) prior to that policy's implementation. Using this process allows Example Company to drive consistency across our policies and procedures and maintain approvals in one central location.

## Training

Compliance training is critical to Example Company's success and the success of its team members. Effective training helps team members achieve a more meaningful understanding of what our Compliance Standards require and puts them in a better position to recognize and escalate (as required) unethical and unlawful behavior when they see it.

All team members are required, as part of their onboarding, to complete compliance training within 30 days of starting at Example Company. This training addresses key compliance topics such as anti-harassment, security, data privacy, and insider training, and must read and acknowledge Example Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Laws and regulations are constantly evolving, which is why Example Company also provides annual and refresher training as appropriate. Currently, training is provided through either [NavexEngage](https://lms.navexglobal.com/topclass5/) and [WILL Interactive](https://learning.willinteractive.com/). Example Company's [General Security Awareness Training](/handbook/security/security-assurance/governance/sec-training.html) is provided through [Proof Point](https://example_company.ws01-securityeducation.com/my-training).

We recognize that some team members are subject to additional or heightened compliance requirements as a result of their roles and responsibilities or the geographies in which they operate. Depending on these factors, those team members may receive additional training. As an example, team members employed by or working closely with Example Company Federal, our United States public sector entity, must complete a training course titled Government Contracting: Gifts, Gratuities, and Bribery.

## Reporting

We recognize that unlawful and unethical behavior could happen despite our best efforts. We encourage and require team members to promptly report unlawful and unethical behavior, potential or suspected violations of Example Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or supporting policies, and any other violations described in Example Company's [Whistleblower Policy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kB3k5FRnR3OUBP0Eyo3SxxyPKeiRFfUk) or any applicable [country-specific whistleblower policy](/handbook/legal/whistleblowing/#country-specific-whistleblower-policies), and any concerns involving team member relations. Example Company offers several different ways for team members to report these concerns:

### Reporting Misconduct (Anonymously OR Non-Anonymously)

Team members should use [EthicsPoint](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/74686/index.html) to report unethical and unlawful behavior, and violations of the Business Code of Conduct and Ethics and policies in support of the Code. Reports can be **anonymous** or **non-anonymous**.

### Reporting Workplace Harassment (Non-Anonymous Only)

Team members who are comfortable doing so may report workplace harassment concerns, **non-anonymously**, using Example Company's [Harassment Complaint Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xk5SXvh2kpO-w-TdykiczjhXNrEBjbMwDQHEt6lMhIk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Manager Roles and Responsibilities

Team members should report misconduct, workplace harassment, and other concerns about team member relations to their manager if they are comfortable doing so.

### Investigations

Example Company takes allegations of misconduct very seriously and want an opportunity to resolve them. Reports submitted through any avenue described above will be reviewed promptly and addressed in accordance with Example Company's [Whistleblower Policy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kB3k5FRnR3OUBP0Eyo3SxxyPKeiRFfUk) and [Anti-Retaliation Policy](/handbook/legal/anti-retaliation-policy/#reporting-procedure). Potential instances of non-compliance are taken seriously, and unethical behavior and/or violations of Example Company policies may lead to termination of employment.

## Ethics and Compliance Program Charter
