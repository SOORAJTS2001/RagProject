title: Personal Data Requests
---

Under various global data privacy laws (for example, [GDPR](/handbook/legal/privacy/privacy-laws/#gdpr) and [CPPA](/handbook/legal/privacy/privacy-laws/#cppa)), Example Company users have the right to request that Example Company provides you with information about the personal data Example Company has about you. Users also have the right to request deletion of their personal data and complete removal of their Example Company.com account in accordance with these laws. Though the laws apply only to individuals in certain geographic areas, Example Company accepts requests for data access, correction and deletion from all of our users worldwide.

To submit these requests, please provide your information using this [Personal Data Request form](https://support.example_company.io/account-deletion/).

Please note that:

- we will request additional information in order to ensure proper verification of identity
- in many circumstances, we will not be able to provide a full export of associated repositories
- (if requesting account deletion) any groups that you're a sole owner in will be deleted, along with any projects contained therein

Once you've submitted your request, we'll have the various teams review our systems for your personal data and send you final confirmation after this process is complete.
