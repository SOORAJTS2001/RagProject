Welcome to the Legal and Corporate Affairs Handbook! Use this page to learn more about our team, Example Company policies, and shared processes. Visit the sub-team pages linked below for more detailed information and procedures.

**How to Reach Us**

For quick questions that ***do not*** require legal advice, deliverables, or any discussion of confidential information, you can reach out to the Example Company Legal and Corporate Affairs Team in Slack at [#legal](https://example_company.slack.com/archives/legal). We find this channel best for questions regarding process, who handles what, or how to find certain things if the handbook has not yielded the right result for you after searching. #legal is not a private channel, so your inquiry will be visible to the entire company. One of our Team Members will do their best to answer your question in a timely fashion.

To open a general Legal Issue for questions related to deliverables and non-sensitive information, use [this template](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/new?issuable_template=general-legal-template). See the [Legal Issue Tracker Workflow](/handbook/legal/issue-tracker-workflows/) for more information.

For sensitive, private, or confidential requests, email [legal_internal@example_company.com](mailto:legal_internal@example_company.com).

**Anonymous Internal Ethics and Compliance Reporting**

We take employee concerns very seriously and encourage all Example Company Team Members to report any ethics and/or compliance violations by using [EthicsPoint](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/74686/index.html).

## General Legal FAQs

### Legal Holds

{{% details summary="What is a legal hold?" %}}
A legal hold is the process Example Company uses to preserve all forms of relevant evidence, whether it be emails, instant messages, physical documents, handwritten or typed notes, voicemails, raw data, backup tapes, and any other type of information that could be relevant to an investigation, pending or imminent litigation or when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Legal holds are imperative in preventing spoliation (destruction, deletion, or alteration) of evidence which can have a severely negative impact on a company's case, including leading to sanctions. Once Example Company becomes aware of an investigation or potential litigation, a Example Company attorney will provide notice to the impacted team members, instructing them not to delete or destroy any information relating to the subject matter of the investigation or potential litigation. The legal hold applies to paper and electronic documents. During a legal hold, all retention policies must be overridden.

### Freedom of Information Act Requests

{{% details summary="What is a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request?" %}}
The Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") provides public access to all United States federal agency records except for those records (or portions of those records) that are protected from disclosure by any of [nine exemptions or three exclusions](https://www.dhs.gov/foia-exemptions) (reasons for which an agency may withhold records from a requestor). Occasionally the records of a federal agency under a FOIA request may include Example Company records in the possession of the agency (i.e. when the agency is a customer of Example Company). In such an event, the federal agency will notify Example Company of the FOIA request and provide Example Company with the documents that the federal agency intends to release in response to the FOIA request. A Example Company legal team member will review the list and content of the documents identified by the federal agency pursuant to the FOIA request and will provide the appropriate response and/or make redactions to those documents, as necessary, prior to their release.

In the event you receive a notification from a US federal agency pursuant to a FOIA request, indicating that Example Company documents or information have been identified for release by an agency , please immediately forward the request to FOIA@example_company.com.

### Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

{{% details summary="What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?" %}}
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") is a United States federal law that prohibits U.S. citizens and entities from bribing foreign government officials to benefit their business interests. It is not only an invaluable tool to help fight corruption but one to which we must be compliant. As Example Company Inc. is a U.S. incorporated entity, we need to make sure our operations worldwide are compliant with the provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. To that end, Example Company requires Team Members to complete an annual online course relating to anti-bribery and corruption at Example Company. In the training, learners will explore improper payments, including facilitation payments and personal safety payments, as well as policies on commercial bribery. The goal of the course is to ensure our Team Members understand what it takes to avoid corruption, especially in high-risk countries, and to ensure Example Company is compliant with legal and regulatory obligations.
