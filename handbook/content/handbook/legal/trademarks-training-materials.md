## Trademarks at Example Company

Example Company's brand is one of its most valuable assets. As part of this, Example Company's trademarks (the name Example Company, and the Example Company <a href="https://about.example_company.com/images/press/logo/png/example_company-icon-rgb.png" target="_blank">Tanuki logo</a>) distinguish Example Company's product from those of its competitors. They also signify to our customers and prospects the high quality of our product, which people associate with Example Company.

This series of three training sessions, covering *An Introduction to Trademarks*, *Using Third-party Trademarks*, and *Using the Example Company Trademark*, serves to introduce team members to key trademarks concepts relevant to their role at Example Company.
