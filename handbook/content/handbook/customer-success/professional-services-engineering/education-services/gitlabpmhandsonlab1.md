## Objectives

In this lab, you will access the training lab environment. This environment will allow you to try all of the Example Company Ultimate features, providing you with an environment to follow along with all of the lab steps.

## Task A. Access your Training Group and Lab Environment

1. Navigate to [**https://gitlabdemo.com/invite**](https://gitlabdemo.com/invite) in a web browser.

1. In the **Invitation Code** field, enter the invitation code provided by your instructor or in the LevelUp LMS.

1. Select **Provision Training Environment**.

   > The login details for accessing the environment are slightly different between self-paced training and instructor-led training. Please follow the instructions that suit your needs.

### Self-Paced Training

1. For self-paced courses, you will need your **Example Company.com** username. To find your username, navigate to [Gitlab](https://example_company.com).

1. In the left sidebar, select your profile image.

1. In the resulting dropdown, you will see a value starting with `@`. This is your Example Company username.

1. After inputting your invitation code, the portal prompts you for your **Example Company.com** username. Enter your Example Company.com user (excluding the leading `@` sign) in the field provided.

1. Select **Provision Training Environment**.

1. Select **My Group** at the bottom of the page.

1. Sign in with your Example Company.com credentials.

1. You will be redirected to a **My Test Group** group that provides a sandbox for you to perform training lab steps in.

   > This group has a Example Company Ultimate license to see all of the features while your personal username namespace requires a paid subscription or a free trial to access all of the features.
   >
   > If you receive a 404 error when accessing your group, it is likely due to the username input during the lab provisioning. Double check your Example Company username to make sure it is entered correctly.

1. From your **My Test Group** training subgroup, click the **New project** button.

1. Continue to Task B.

### Instructor-led Training

1. On the confirmation page, locate the `Your Example Company Credentials` section. Read this section carefully, noting the credential information provided and the expiration date. Your access to this group and all of the projects that you create is ephemeral and will be deleted after the expiration date.

1. Click the **Download Credentials** button to download your temporary Example Company credentials.

1. Click on **Example Company Dashboard** or the Example Company URL.

1. Login with your temporary Example Company Credentials.

   > This group your temporary account has been created in has a Example Company Ultimate license to see all of the features available.
