title: "Customer Terrain Mapping Engagements"
---

Customer Terrain Mapping Engagements provide customers with the benefit of Example Company's experience with DevOps methodologies, Git, Example Company, CI, CD and monitoring by brainstorming a high level, first draft discovery of their specific challenges that need to be addressed for success in a scoped area of DevOps (a Terrain). The need for this generally arises when the customer is getting ready to utilize technologies and/or methodologies they are less familiar with.

### Terrain Mapping Design Goals

- Focus on discovering customer concerns in a scoped area (a Terrain) to apply Example Company solutions to their specific challenges on the ground.
- Facilitate collaboration with customers on articulating critical success factors by co-creating a first draft of a terrain map.
- To help customers and Example Company team members understand scenarios where professional services may play a significant and direct role in ensuring customers can be more successful with implementing and gaining value from Example Company. This directly supports the [publicly stated mission](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/#professional-services-handbook) of Example Company Professional Services as being an extension of Customer Success.
- Generate results rapidly and efficiently through a co-worked document outlining considerations and scope in as little as one 60 minute session.
- To enable reuse and extension, leverage single templates that include brief embedded training and instructions.
- To enable diversity and inclusivity of inputs by using an open collaboration event to build out the deliverable.
- Give the customer a first draft terrain map that can be iteratively improved.
- To exhibit transparency by articulating all the things that are required for success, regardless of whether Example Company has services to offer for the items.
- All of the above goals work together to broaden the scope of **who can facilitate** the session. Facilitation generally requires a technical background, but it is not limited to any specific technical role within Example Company.

### Some Qualifiers

- Regardless of whether the customer chooses not to use professional services, the document is a high-value artifact that they can develop further.
- The Customer Terrain Mapping activity does not include detailed design discussions nor doing the actual work to make progress on any of the identified items.
- Generally one Customer Terrain Map is offered per SA customer engagement.
- If the customer chooses to use an applicable professional service, the engagement document will help rapidly understand the customer perspectives to scope and price the engagement. (Efficient reuse)

### Further Iterations of Customer Terrain Maps

Like anything in the handbook, it is everyone's responsibility and prerogative to improve these materials through corrections and enhancements. At the same time, Terrain Mapping reflects adherence to specific design principles to deliver the items documented above in Customer Terrain Mapping Design Goals.  For those wishing to make substantial changes or generate entirely new Terrain maps, these design principles are documented here: [Terrain Mapping Overview and Design Principles (Example Company Team Members Only)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aphwxd6LwwyfVlqNbbTzLgKyjZEX-jvpmEWEyC4XXQg/edit?usp=sharing)
