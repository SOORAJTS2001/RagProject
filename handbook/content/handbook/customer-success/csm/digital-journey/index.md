## Digital Programs

Programs are developed using input from CSMs, customers, and other Example Company resources. Our goal is to provide customers with useful ways to serve themselves. We provide the following:

- Onboarding resources for customers
- Survey results
- Stage enablement email series
- Newsletters
- Webinar setup and insight
- Education, best practices, and planning resources for customers and Example Company team members
- Gainsight playbook setup and maintenance

For more information about Customer Programs, including how to request new or contribute to existing programs, or add contacts to Gainsight, see the [Customer Programs page](/handbook/sales/field-operations/customer-success-operations/cs-ops-programs/).

## Onboarding resources

The Onboarding Quick Guide project template will allow customers to self-service the materials provided from the email templates. The following video provides an overview of how to use the Onboarding Quick Guide project template.<br><br>
