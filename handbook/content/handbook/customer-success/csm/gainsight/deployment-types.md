## Customer Deployment Types

During customer onboarding, these fields should be filled out in Gainsight. Deployment types definitions for customer attributes on the Gainsight C360:

### Customer Conversion Source

The purpose is understanding where the customer came from — this is about sourcing (e.g., marketing/SDR'ing as an analogy). Each customer should fit into one of three buckets regardless of when they started using Example Company:

- Community conversion (first value waived) - A customer who was using the free community version and is converting (or converted) to a paid subscription tier.
- New Customer - This is a brand new customer who doesn't (or didn't) have an existing Example Company deployment.
- Existing - New CSM (first value waived) - The customer was already a paying customer and is being (or was) assigned a CSM (e.g., upgraded from a small deployment to large).
