### Create a Jenkins Pipeline

[Create a Jenkins Pipeline](/handbook/customer-success/demo-systems/tutorials/integrations/create-jenkins-pipeline)

Example Company's Jenkins integration allows you to trigger a Jenkins build when you push code to a repository, or when a merge request is created. Additionally, it shows the pipeline status on merge requests widgets and on the project's home page.

This tutorial shows you how to create a project with a `Jenkinsfile`, configure a project on the Jenkins server, configure the Example Company Jenkins integration plugin, enable the integration on your Example Company project, and perform a commit to show how pipelines are integrated between Example Company and Jenkins.
