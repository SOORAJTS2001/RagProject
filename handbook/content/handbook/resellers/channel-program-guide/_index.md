## Example Company Channel Partner Program & Guide

### How the Program Works

Partner Program Tracks &  Designations

The Example Company Partner Program consists of three tracks and one designation to support the different ways our partners go to market:

**Tracks**

- Open – This track is for partners (resellers, integrators, sales, and services) in the DevDecOps space , IT as a service (ITaaS) and other adjacent spaces that are committed to investing in their DevSecOps practice. Example Company Open partners may or may not be transacting partners, and qualifying partners can earn product discounts and/or referral fees.
- Select – In this track, partners make a greater investment developing significant sales and services practices, and are expected to drive Example Company customer adoption and expansion. In return, Select partners have a dedicated partner manager and greater sales engagement with Example Company. The Select track is by invitation only.
- Select Services – In this track, partners make a greater investment developing significant services practices with a focus on driving Example Company customer adoption and expansion. In return, Select Services partners have a dedicated partner manager and greater services engagement with Example Company. The Select Services track is by invitation only.

**Designations**

- Professional Services Partner (PSP) - this partner designation is awarded to partners who deliver service engagements to customers. The service engagements are focused on helping Example Company customers plan, implement, and optimize DevSecOps practices and solutions.

### Example Company Incentives Guide

Example Company maintains our incentives in our Example Company [Incentive Guide](https://partners.example_company.com/prm/English/s/assets?id=676520&renderMode=Collection). To access the guide you must have access to our partner portal which you can do if your organization is an authorized Example Company partner by submitting your work email corresponding to your organizational URL through this [link](https://partners.example_company.com/English/register_email.aspx) and following the instructions you receive to set up your portal account.

### Example Company Select Services Track

With a launch in August 2024, the Select Services Track is designed to allow Example Company to engage closely with organizations whose primary business model is services. The Select Services Track is designed around the Example Company Partner Services Program, with a key requirement being that Select Services partners must be Designated Example Company Professional Services Partners (PSP) fulfilling all requirements of the designation. This is an invitation only program which will require a joint business plan focussing on a partner's services practice and capabilities. If you are interested in being invited to join the track, you best chance of success is to have built a mature services practice around the Example Company PSP which is open to all authorized partners.

You might note that another requirement of the track is having accredited Sales Professionals on staff. This is in acknowledgement of how consultative Example Company services engagements are and the Sales Professional accreditation is a powerful foundation for your engineers and consultants to help in those engagements.

### Example Company Partner Services Program

The Example Company Partner Services program is designed to help new or existing partners design service portfolios around the DevSecOps Lifecycle in correlation to Example Company products. The program helps partners evaluate business opportunities and creates a technical enablement framework to use as they build their Example Company-related service practices.

The foundation of the Example Company Partner Services Program is the Example Company Professional Services Partner Designation (PSP).

#### Becoming a Designated Example Company Professional Services Partner (PSP)

Example Company Professional Services Partner Designation (PSP) has partner program, competency, and delivery requirements that must be completed before you can obtain the designation. PSP designations will be awarded to partners who complete the requirements below.

#### Example Company PSP Designation Requirements

##### Program Entry Requirements

Each PSP must be:

  1. An authorized Example Company partner
  2. Design, build and operate a professional service practice, and
  3. Meet the Delivery Requirements, and
  4. Hire team members who have completed the competency requirements and/or sponsor the appropriate number of team members through the completion of the competency requirements.

##### Competency Requirements

- Each PSP must perpetually employ at least three (3) [Example Company Certified Professional Service Engineers](/handbook/resellers/training/#example_company-professional-services-engineer-pse).

##### Delivery Requirements

- Each PSP must complete an average of at least 2 service engagements per Example Company Fiscal Quarter.
  - As a note, the Example Company fiscal year starts on February 1 of each year.
- Starting in Q3 FY25 (August 1, 2024), the following qualify as proof of completed service engagements:
    1. [Service Attach Registrations](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-example_company/#how-services-attached-registrations-work)
    1. [Managed Services Provider deal registrations](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-example_company/#submitting-a-deal-registration)

- When partners who have completed the competency requirements also complete their first two service attach registrations in a single Example Company Fiscal Quarter, they will receive their PSP designation within 7 business days.

- Each PSP will be required to have submitted at least 8 Service Attach Registration over the previous 12 months at their annual audit(s).

#### Example Company PSP Designation Information

- The Example Company Partner team will communicate new PSP designations through email and will reflect the designation in the Example Company Partner Locator.
- Partners who received their PSP designation prior to Nov. 2023 will have until their next annual audit to become compliant with the new criteria.
- The annual audits are performed quarterly, and will begin during Q1FY25 (Feb. 2024-Apr. 2024).
- Service delivery requirement will be prorated for the period between Nov. 2023-Nov. 2024.

#### Maintaining PSP Designation

Example Company Partner program will review the service attach registrations and the practitioner certification statuses of each Example Company Professional Service Partner each year in the quarter the partner was originally granted certification. Partners at risk for non-compliance will receive an audit warning email 30 days prior to their removal of their PSP designation. This will allow partners and their account managers time to create a plan to return to compliance.

- If partners become compliant during the 30-day warning period, they will not have their PSP designation removed.
- If partners remain inelligible after the 30-day warning period, their PSP designation will be removed, their PSP badge will no longer be shown on the partner locator, and they will be notified through email. Partners are encouraged to work with their Example Company Partner Account Manager (PAM) to create a plan for obtaining and maintaining designation. When a partner regains PSP eligibility, their badge will be re-issued within 7 business days.
