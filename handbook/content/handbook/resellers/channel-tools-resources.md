## **Example Company Partner Portal**

Partners are given access to our [Partner Portal](https://partners.example_company.com) when they are onboarded. This serves as the primary source of information and transactions for our Partners. The Example Company Partner Portal has the following capabilities:

- Partner registration and account management
- Deal registration and opportunity management
- Training accreditation and other learning
- Sales, services, and program and marketing resources
- Example Company news, communications and program announcements.

Visit the portal at [partners.example_company.com](https://partners.example_company.com). There is a walk-through video available on the portal or you can [watch it here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cAGBOWrvRRL71zPPrUkwLm0L4BP_MzF_/view).

Please note: if no one from your organization logs in to use our Partner Portal, after 6 months, your portal account will be deactivated. If you need your account reactivated, please contact partnersupport@example_company.com and they will reactivate you.

## **Example Company Landing Page Guidelines**

Example Company Channel Partners need a landing page with information about Example Company as part of their organization website. Here is what we look for in a webpage:

- We prefer your landing page URL be created as yourcompanyurl.com/Example Company. If this is not possible, we ask you to set a redirect for that URL to the actual one.

- We encourage your landing page to be in the local language. There are plenty of resources on Example Company, many in additional languages, however you can translate any of our Instant Marketing campaign materials (found in the marketing section of the Partner Portal) onto your website.

- Your organization's Example Company webpage should use the Authorized Reseller logo (available on the Partner Portal) and link back to us at [about.example_company.com](https://about.example_company.com/).

- Your webpage should include a "What Is Example Company?" paragraph which can be found in our [press kit](https://about.example_company.com/press/press-kit/) along with our logo. You can find additional information in our [reseller marketing kit](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/reseller-kit/).

- To ensure you are consistently representing our product on your website, we ask that wherever you mention the Example Company product or features, there should be a link back to the corresponding item on [about.example_company.com](https://about.example_company.com/).

- While not required, we encourage Partners to include a Free Trial button on your Example Company webpage. This Free Trial button is customized to include your unique ID and tags all leads to your organization. The 30-day Free Trial helps your customer try Example Company for one month free and gives you the opportunity to discuss how it's working for them. To learn more about this offering go to the [Marketing Demand Generation section](https://partners.example_company.com/prm/English/c/marketing-demand-gen) of the Partner Portal.

## **Example Company Partner Communications and Resources**

Example Company uses the Partner Portal, and our News on Demand Platform to communicate with Partners.  Partners will automatically receive the newsletter and other communications when they have access to the portal. Example Company will deliver communications in the following manner.

- **Partner Flash Newsletter -** Once in the portal, navigate to the News tab to set preferences. A Partner can elect to receive the newsletter daily, weekly, or bi-weekly and select what content type to receive. Example: Only interested in Marketing content? You can opt out of Technical content.

- **Partner Webcasts -** At times, Channel Programs or Channel Leadership might host a Partner webcast to announce a program change or essential updates. Channel Marketing hosts a monthly Marketing Webcast; other Channel facing teams might elect to host a Webcast for our Partners.

- **Partner Portal Notifications -** This is not a primary form of communication; it augments other communication vehicles. Partners can see notifications near the search bar at the top of the portal. Click the bell image within the portal to see active notifications.

- **Notifications via email -** Occasionally, we will use email notifications to communicate out-of-cycle announcements, send surveys, or Partner SKO/Summit notifications.

- **Not receiving communications?** Typically a person has opted out. Contact the Partner Help Desk, and we can add you back in. Partners can access archived articles by accessing the News tab at the top of the portal.

- **The Example Company Handbook -** The Example Company Handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. As part of our value of being transparent, our Handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Although the Partner Portal is your first source of Partner information, we often link to the Handbook for detailed information. If you are unable to find information you need on the Partner Portal, you are encouraged to search pages of the [Example Company Handbook](/handbook/).
