## Zoom-specific communication guides

Example Company uses [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) as the primary video collaboration platform for internal and external communications. Some of our customers and partners have different preferred tools and to facilitate the communication with those parties, Example Company provides licenses for WebEx and MS Teams. This service is only provided to team members that have a business need to host meetings and where Zoom is not accepted. It is not efficient for Example Company to use multiple video conferencing tools, however we encourage the use of the most popular ones among our customers and partners when needed. E.g.; Zoom, WebEx, MS Teams, Skype, etc.

To request access to those tools, create an [access request](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request) and provide a justification for access.

### Usage guidelines

Please visit the [Tools and Tips handbook](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#zoom) for Zoom usage guidelines.

### Using Zoom for personal connection

[COVID-19](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/covid-19/) is impacting how team members connect and communicate with family.

Due to school closures, parents are tasked with being responsible for their children while at home. [Family and friends first, work second](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second) is an important Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging operating principle. To that end, we are encouraging Example Company team members to allow their children to connect with other children around the world.

During this time of physical distancing, Example Company team members are welcome to use Zoom to connect with family if other options like FaceTime, etc. are not an option. Please ensure that attendees who are not Example Company team members have their own Zoom account. To ensure Example Company does not incur toll charges, please use Internet-based voice when possible.
