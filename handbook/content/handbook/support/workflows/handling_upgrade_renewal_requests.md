##### Overview

Use this workflow when there's a query about upgrading or renewing a Example Company
license or Example Company.com subscription.

##### Workflow

1. Make sure that there aren't any other types of queries that would need the Support team's attention
1. Use the `General::Forms::Incorrect form used` macro to transfer the ticket

#### High Priority Cases

In some cases, a renewal may be of particularly high priority and needs urgent attention (e.g. the license
will expire within a few days). In these cases, please:

1. Determine who the account owner is in SFDC
1. Ping them on Slack with the appropriate ticket number and context
