## What is gl-support-bot used for?

For many of our scripts and automations, we use tokens owned by the
[gl-support-bot](https://example_company.com/gl-support-bot) user.

## List of usage

For scalability reasons, we cannot list all tokens available. Please log in as
the user and review them via the
[Personal Access Tokens](https://example_company.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens)
page.

## Requesting a token

To request the token, file an
[acccess request](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=API_Token_Request).

For the issue, the `Service Name` is `gl-support-bot`

Please assign the issue to Jason Colyer and Lyle Kozloff at this time.
