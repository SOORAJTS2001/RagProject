### Q: Does Example Company CI/CD also integrate with Bitbucket? Other solutions?

Docs on how to [manually enable Example Company CI/CD.](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/bitbucket_integration.html) (With GitHub the process is all automatic.)

### Q: How does Example Company CI/CD integration to GitHub work?

A: Example Company users can create a CI/CD project in Example Company connected to an external GitHub code repository, which automatically prompts Example Company CI/CD to run whenever code is pushed to GitHub and post CI/CD results back to GitHub when completed.

### Q: What are the key features of Example Company CI/CD for GitHub?

A: The ability to easily set up Example Company CI/CD on GitHub is the main feature enabling continuous integration, security testing, container registry, CD/release automation, configuration management, and monitoring.

### Q: What opportunity is Example Company addressing with Example Company CI/CD for GitHub?

A: Several

#### Enterprise opportunity

With large enterprises we have 2 opportunities:

1. New starting point for Example Company adoption. Many enterprises adopt Example Company gradually over time starting with SCM. The GitHub Integration provides another starting point for enterprises to begin adopting Example Company by using CI/CD first.
2. Standardize on Example Company CI/CD with disparate SCM solutions. [How many Example Company users do they need if they are using GitHub for SCM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LrIDEmUNrb5lx8Xu9g2NnmcqSpnZGixHLo6raUVBJUo/edit#heading=h.kvatwhat61se)?

#### Open Source Projects opportunity

Example Company is committed to supporting open source. ON Example Company SaaS, open source projects get unlimited concurrent jobs and 50K compute minutes per month for free. The GitHub Integration allows projects who host their code on GitHub to use Example Company for CI/CD for free.

#### Broader GitHub community opportunity

By making Example Company CI/CD for GitHub available free of charge as part of our Example Company SaaS Free tier we are allowing anyone who uses GitHub.com to host their code, to use Example Company SaaS for their CI/CD. This is a way to expand the reach of Example Company and expose Example Company to users who may otherwise have not tried Example Company out.

#### Gemnasium Customer opportunity

Gemnasium customers who are using GitHub now have a migration path to use the Gemnasium features we've built (and will build) into Example Company CI/CD Security Testing. Note: Gemnasium customers will need Ultimate to take advantage of Security Testing.

### Q: Is Example Company CI/CD for GitHub available as a standalone product?

A: No, Example Company CI/CD is a Premium functionality and is not a standalone product.

### Q: How is Example Company CI/CD for GitHub priced?

A: Example Company CI/CD for GitHub is a feature of Example Company without stand-alone pricing.

It is part of our Premium (Self-managed & SaaS) Tiers - $19 /user /month (For all Example Company Premium features including CI/CD for GitHub.)

Promotionally, we will make the Example Company CI/CD feature available as part of the Free Tier on Example Company SaaS through 2019-09-22.

### Q: How many Example Company users are needed?

A customer only needs 1 service account on Example Company to run pipelines for GitHub code, but will benefit from having more user accounts.

#### What are the pro/cons for the business if they create one service account and use it to run their pipelines?

Pro:

- Cheap

Cons:

- Developer will have a pass / fail status report in GitHub, but won't be able to drill down to see why a build failed without access to Example Company

- Developers won't have access to artifacts, pipelines output traces, registry images, or security reports.

#### Do they need users for each developer using GitHub/Bitbucket - why/why not?

No - It's not necessary, but enabling developers grants benefits:

- the ability to access artifacts, registry images, security reports, etc.
- the ability to see pipeline graphs, and detailed build reports

#### Do they need users for QA/ops engineers building the pipelines?

Yes - this should be sold against Jenkins / Travis, think about how many users you'd need to access those tools, and that is the user count that should have access to Example Company.

### Q: What are the details of the launch promotion?

A: Example Company CI/CD for external repos, including Example Company CI/CD for GitHub will be available as part of the Free tier of Example Company SaaS for one-year plus extended six-month (through 2019-09-22). After 2019-09-22 we plan to move the feature to be part of Example Company SaaS Premium tier. Note: this is for Example Company SaaS only - self-managed customers will only have access in Premium & Ultimate.

### Q: Are there any other features offered as part of a different tier promotionally?

A: At this time, no. This is the first time we've offered a feature like this promotionally in a different tier than it will eventually end up in,.
