title: "2019 DevOps Dozen - Best DevOps Solution Provider: Example Company"
---

*This is one of two pages submitted for the [2019 DevOps Dozen Awards](https://devopsdozen.com/), supporting Example Company for Best DevOps Solution Provider and supporting Sid Sijbrandij for Best DevOps Solution Provider Executive. We thank MediaOps and [DevOps.com](https://devops.com/) for their consideration and their service to the DevOps community.*

### Example Company: A community **and** a product

The Example Company solution is the result of collaboration between thousands of community contributors, based on feedback from the over 100,000 organizations that have adopted Example Company to power their DevOps transformations. The Example Company community contributes code, documentation, translation, design, and product ideas based on their real world challenges, making Example Company more useful and valuable. Because of the community behind Example Company, in many cases, we see rapid adoption through better developer experience and collaboration. These naturally drive users to adopt and contribute more, enriching the application every day.

### Example Company: A complete DevOps platform, in a single application

Example Company fundamentally changes the way development, security, and ops teams collaborate and build software — helping customers on their DevOps journey in ways no other company can — by providing [a single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle](https://about.example_company.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/).

DevOps toolchains are often complex, fragile, and expensive to maintain. Teams are further slowed by hand-offs and re-work. Across toolchains in a company, teams can be siloed by DevOps software that was supposed to help eliminate siloes.

Example Company customers can have SCM, CI, security, and more in one browser window. They can minimize integrations and get back to releasing great software. Example Company CI and CD are truly continuous, speeding up releases and revenues. With one user experience, one permission model, and one conversation from portfolio management to production monitoring, companywide gains include visibility, collaboration, and speed — making good on the promise of DevOps.

### A partner like no other

Example Company is uniquely open and transparent about our [vision and roadmap](https://about.example_company.com/direction/), [our internal processes](/handbook/), our [product maturity](https://about.example_company.com/direction/#maturity), and we invite and encourage [community and customer contributions and collaboration](https://about.example_company.com/community/contribute/).

### What people are saying

#### Customer case studies

[Our case studies feature Example Company customers sharing their accomplishments, in their own words](https://about.example_company.com/customers/), including the few introduced below.

- Goldman Sachs had already started their DevOps journey, but progress had stalled before they began using Example Company. After reducing their toolchain complexity by implementing Example Company for development, source code control and reviews, builds, testing, QA, and production deployments, [Goldman Sachs' build velocity was dramatically improved, from 1 build every 2 weeks to over 1,000 per day](https://about.example_company.com/customers/goldman-sachs/).

- At BI Worldwide, they had built multiple, complex DevOps toolchains resulting in issues like lost bug reports and constant context shifting. Now [with broadening Example Company adoption, they describe their DevOps success](https://about.example_company.com/customers/bi_worldwide/):

> "One tool for SCM+CI/CD was a big initial win. Now wrapping security scans into that tool as well has already increased our visibility into security vulnerabilities. The integrated Docker registry has also been very helpful for us. Issue/Product management features let everyone operate in the same space regardless of role."
