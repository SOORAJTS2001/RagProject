***Note:** The sponsorship for Stack Overflow's Example Company Collective concluded on September 30, 2022 and the Example Company Collective was decomissioned. All of knowledge and submissions shared by our community will be retained. Articles and answers to questions about Example Company will be decoupled from the Collective and continue to exist in the public Stack Overflow knowledge base.

The [Example Company Collective on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/example_company) groups content related to Example Company in one place. The Example Company Collective creates a space to engage with our community on Stack Overflow though questions, answers, knowledge articles, and bulletins.
