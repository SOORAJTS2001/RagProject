Subscriptions granted under the Example Company for Open Source Program **do not auto-renew**.

We recommend that applicants begin the renewal process at least one month in advance of their renewal dates to ensure sufficient processing time.

#### How does someone renew their membership in the Example Company for Open Soure Program?

Subscriptions granted under the Example Company for Open Source Program do not auto-renew.

### Program management resources

#### Updating the program application page

When seeking to edit the Example Company for Open Source application page, find the appropriate file at `data/solution_children/join.yml`.

#### Managing the program support queue

Members of the [Community Programs team](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-programs/) use Example Company Service Desk to manage program members' support requests.

* When a support issue is pending program member review and/or additional details, it should receive the `OS Program Supprt::Pending` label.
* When a support issue has been resolved, it should receive the `OS Program Support::Closed` label.

## Example Company Open Source Partners

The [Example Company Open Source Partners](https://about.example_company.com/solutions/open-source/partners/) program exists to build relationships with prominent open source projects using Example Company as a critical component of their infrastructure.
By building these relationships, Example Company hopes to strengthen the open source ecosystem.

Open source partners receive specific benefits by joining the program.
Example Company benefits from these partnerships when open source partners provide valuable feedback and data on their use of Example Company, even contribute to Example Company's open core.
All parties jointly benefit when they're able to collaborate on community outreach, co-marketing, joint announcements, and special initiatives.

### FAQs

#### What are the benefits of being a member of the Example Company Open Source Partners program?

Program members receive:

* Public recognition as a Example Company Open Source Partner
* Direct line of communication to Example Company
* Assistance migrating additional infrastructure to Example Company
* Exclusive invitations to participate in Example Company events

* Plan and participate in joint initiatives and events

#### Who qualifies for the Example Company Open Source Partners program?

While most partners are also members of the Example Company for Open Source Program, not all are (as some partners are commercial open source entities and therefore ineligible for the program).
Most partners use Example Company Ultimate (either SaaS or self-managed); however, some prefer using the fully open source [Community Edition](https://about.example_company.com/install/ce-or-ee/) because of their strong commitment to using only open source tools.

Membership in Example Company Open Source Partners program is largely by invitation.
Example Company team members can nominate projects as partners by opening an issue in the `Open Source Partners Program` [project](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program) and applying the [appropriate issue template](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program/-/blob/master/.example_company/issue_templates/open-source-partner-nomination.md)
Members of the open source program team extend invitations to longtime members of the Example Company for Open Source Program, projects using Example Company in interesting and innovative ways from which others can learn, or projects with large communities and brand recognition already using Example Company for everyday operations.

The Example Company Open Source Partners Program project contains sensitive data and personally identifying information about program members.
It is therefore [accessible only to Example Company team members](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#safe).

### Program management resources

#### Managing projects

Work on the Example Company Open Source Partners program occurs in two primary locations:

* [Example Company Open Source Partners](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/example_company-open-source-partners), a **public group** and the default location for program activity. Program members receive access to the project and `Developer`-level persmission inside it. It's the place where program members, Example Company team memebers, and the wider open source community can interact, collaborate, share, and build.
* [Open Source Partners Program](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program), a **private project** accessible only to Example Company team members. This project is private because it contains sensitive personal data pertaining to open source partners, a [board tracking ongoing partner outreach](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program/-/boards/5537534), and a private service desk exclusively for Example Company Open Source Partners working on non-public issues. See the [Developer Relations Program Management handbook section](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/project-management/) to learn more.

#### Welcoming new partners

We maintain [email templates](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program/-/tree/master/templates) to help us interact with prospective and current partners.
When an organization has joined the Example Company Open Source Partners program, we send a comprehensive [program guide](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/example_company-open-source-partners/community-resources/-/blob/main/program-guide/example_company-open-source-partners-program-guide.pdf) and complete a [partner onboarding issue](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program/-/blob/master/.example_company/issue_templates/open-source-partner-onboarding.md).

### Collecting and managing partner contact details

We maintain a confidential, non-public [register of our partners' contact details](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program/-/tree/master/current-partners) so we can remain connected to them.

When partners join the program, we instruct them to submit key community contact information to the private partner service desk at `ospartners@example_company.com`.
The Open Source Program Manager responds to these requests and updates internal documentation.

We periodically request updated contact information from partners to ensure we remain connected to the proper community representatives.

We try to maintain partner registries containing the following community contacts:

* **Primary:** The person representing the project and/or community at meetings and serving as our principal connection to the project.
* **Alternate:** The person we can contact if we're unable to reach the primary contact.
* **Marketing:** The person we contact when partner event and marketing opportunities arise.
* **Technical:** The person we contact regarding participation in surveys or focus studies that require technical expertise, or when something at Example Company may require input from technical contacts at open source partner organizations.
* **Legal:** (optional) The person we contact to weigh in on legal matters, such as updates to terms of service agreements, partnership activities, or permission to use a project's logo.

#### Renewing and extending partner subscriptions

Members of the Example Company Open Source Partners program who are also members of the Example Company for Open Source Program may be eligible for an extended-period subscription.
The current extended subscription renewal period is **36 months**.

Partners seeking extended-period renewals should email their requests to `opensource@example_company.com`.
Partners should use this template to format their requests:

```text
Subject: Open Source Partner (Application/Renewal)
Subscription Term: 36
Number of seats you are requesting:
The license type to be issued (Self-Managed or SaaS):
List any change of ownership to the account:
(If account ownership details change, please send the new account holder's name, email address, and contact's mailing address)
```

When a request is processed and accepted, applicants will be asked to sign a $0 quote with a 36-month term.
After that:

* For **Saas**: No further action is necessary.
* For **Self-managed**: Applicants need to download licenses from the Example Company Customer Portal and upload them to their instances.

#### Tracking partner issues

Example Company's open source partners requesting support track most of their issues publicly.
They do this via issue trackers located in the [Example Company Open Source Partners](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/example_company-open-source-partners) group—most commonly the [Community Support](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/example_company-open-source-partners/community-support/-/issues) project.
Here, fellow open source partners and Example Company team members can collaborate on supporting Example Company's open source partners.

Partners may wish to open issues related to their work migrating infrastructure from legacy infrastructure to Example Company (for instance, note examples from [KDE](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/example_company-open-source-partners/community-support/-/issues/7), [Drupal](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/example_company-open-source-partners/community-support/-/issues/4), and [Freedesktop.org](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/example_company-open-source-partners/community-support/-/issues/9)).
To create migration-focused issues, partners can use the `open-source-partner-migration` issue template.

Occasionally, partners must open support issues that contain sensitive details about their projects.
To do this, they email the partner service desk at `osspartners@example_company.com`.
We then track these issues on the (private) [Example Company Open Source Partners Support board](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program/-/boards/2150795).

#### Sharing partner stories

The Example Company Open Source Partners program is a commuinity-focused marketing effort designed to highlight ways high-profile open source communities are using—and succeeding with—Example Company.
As such, we aim to share partner stories whenever possible.

We do this in many ways, including:

* posts on the Example Company blog
* case studies for Example Company.com
* webcasts and webinars for Example Company's video channels
* event showcases and presentations

We tag partner-related stories with the `open-source` tag on [the Example Company Blog](https://about.example_company.com/blog/categories/open-source/).

We often connect with partners when we feel we can help them share stories related to:

* Their plans to migrate infrastructure to Example Company
* Their success at migrating infrastructure to Example Company
* Their innovative use of Example Company to build something notable or solve a technical/social challenge for their project and community
* Their resolution of critical technical challenges that align with themes central to other Example Company marketing campaigns (e.g., CI/CD, security, or project management)

We track the status of this work with the [Example Company Open Source Partners Editorial Queue](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/example_company-open-source-partners/publications-and-presentations/-/boards/5105228).

#### Adding a new logo to the Open Source Partners program page

Members of the Example Company Open Source Partners program are listed on the [partner program landing page](https://about.example_company.com/solutions/open-source/partners/). Follow these instructions to add a new logo to the roster.

1. Retrieve the partner logo in the highest resolution available.
1. Resize the logo so it conforms to something roughly the size of a 72px cube, then save it in `PNG` format. Use a file naming convention that looks like `partner-logo.file-name.png`.
1. Load the `partners.yml` [file](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/blob/main/content/solutions/open-source/partners.yml) and open it in an editor.
1. Add the logo URL, image alt text, and partner landing page in accordance with the yaml convention in the file.
1. Locate the `/static/nuxt-images/open-source` folder in the Example Company codebase.
1. Add the resized version of the partner logo to that folder.
1. Create a merge request to merge the updated partner roster and logo

## Consortium Memberships and Sponsorships

Example Company's open source program team also oversees Example Company's representation and participation in select industry consortia, as well as Example Company's sponsorship of select open source community events.

### FAQs

#### What is a consortium?

We define "consortium" as a group created to further some technological cause.
In the context of open source software, a prototypical consortium would be the [Linux Foundation (LF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation), a non-profit organization founded in 2000 as a merger between Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group, which [hosts and promotes](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/) collaborative development of open source software projects.

#### Why is consortium marketing important?

Consortia are influential leaders in their respective ecosystems, as they often host conferences and underwrite programs that influence global conversations about particular technological developments.
Participating in consortia enhances Example Company's brand—and helps align Example Company's engineering efforts with global efforts and trends.

#### How does Example Company participate in consortium activities?

While select consortium memberships fall within the purview (and budget) of Example Company's open source program, the [Developer Advocacy team](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/) focuses on consortium marketing, working to integrate Example Company's overall community message and technical perspective into the most appropriate and effective industry conversations.

#### How can I recommend Example Company get involved in a consortium?

You can open an issue in the [Consortium Memberships project](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/consortium-memberships). When you do, please use the `membership-evaluation` template to structure your issue.
Open source program team members will evaluate your application using the following criteria.
When we review the application, we'll assess it with these considerations in mind:

* Awareness opportunities
* Ease of collaboration
* Contribution and hiring pool

| Considerations | What we're interested in | Questions we're asking |
| ---------------| ------------------------ | -----------------------|
| Awareness opportunities | Size of the organization<br /><br />Frequency and impact of marketing opportunities<br /><br />| How many authenticated and non-authenticated users are visiting organization's website monthly?<br /><br />How many people are part of the organization's community?<br /><br />What sorts of marketing and communication channels (social media platforms, newsletters, blogs, events) does the organization use?<br /><br /> Will Example Company appear in those official channels? How prominent would our placement be? |
| Ease of collaboration | Access to a dedicated marketing resources/point person<br /><br />Time-to-execute for standard communication types | Does the organization have marketing capacity?<br /><br />How mature is the organization's brand and marketing portions?<br /><br />How quickly can this organization produce a resource (e.g., a case study)? A week? A month? A quarter?<br /><br />How responsive is the person in charge of the relationship?<br /><br />Is marketing handled by volunteers or paid employees? |
| Contribution and hiring pool | Size of contributor/member base<br /><br />Overall community/member activity<br /><br />Frequency of community contribution<br /><br />Rate of adoption | How active is the community the organization is attempting to foster?<br /><br /> Does the organization have a sense of its community's health?<br /><br />Do we see hiring opportunities to recruit from the community's talent pool?<br /><br />What is the growth of the community or foundation itself?<br /><br />Do we see job opportunities within that software ecosystem (are people hiring contributors from this community in general)?<br /><br />How can Example Company contribute in ways that align with our interests?<br /><br />Can Example Company participate in the project's roadmap in ways that creates mutual value? |

#### In which consortia is Example Company involved?

We are currently members of the following consortia:

* [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/)
* [Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://www.finos.org/)
* [InnerSource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org/)
* [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)
* [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/)
* [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/)

[Complete details of Example Company's activities](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/consortium-memberships) with these groups are available in the `Consortium Memberships` project.
Note that because this project contains sensitive data and personally identifying information, it is [only accessible to Example Company team members](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#safe).

### Program management resources

#### Elections for Board of Directors opportunities

Some of the consortia in which we participate allow members to run for their respective Boards of Directors.
Anyone interested in becoming more involved in any of the consortia Example Company supports should visit the `Consortium Memberships` [project](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/community-relations/opensource-program/consortium-memberships) and open an issue.

Review the information below if you're thinking of seeking nomination for (or election to) consortium positions.

**Internal nominations**
The Developer Relations team tracks consortium board elections closely.
In the event that an election opportunity arises, the team will create a confidential issue in the `Consortium Memberships` [project](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/consortium-memberships) to discuss it.
The team will determine which Example Company team member(s) could serve effectively in the elected position.
Their considerations prioritize the following criteria:

* Expertise and experience with the technologies we hope to influence as part of the organization's board
* Pre-existing relationships with current board members and member organizations that could aid electability
* Tenure at Example Company and seniority in role at Example Company

The team will connect individually with the top candidate it feels would best suit the role given the above requirements, then ask that individual about their willingness and availability to serve.
Candidates should consider the required time investment and their capacity for attending board meetings and representing Example Company at consortium events.
Should the candidate wish to serve, the team will confirm the selection with the marketing organization leadership, then work with the nominee to prepare all requisite paperwork and craft a nomination statement.
The team maintains a list of [candidacy statements](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/consortium-memberships/-/blob/master/resources/sample-election-candidate-statements.md) for reference and aid in this process.
Should the candidate defer due to time or other constraints, the team will connect with the next person on the priority list given the above criteria.

**Campaigning**
Once Example Company candidates are nominated, the Developer Relations team can help them campaign for their positions.
We'll make other Example Company team members aware of the election and equip them to assist your campaign, too (e.g., by announcing the campaign on the `#whats-happening-at-example_company` Slack channel).

**Promoting**
The social media team is able to promote elections notification news.
They simply need a place to point people, preferably an updated webpage that lists the board of directors or a social media post from the organization that mentions the election results.

#### Event sponsorships

Example Company's Developer Relations team maintains a small budget for sponsorship of events that allow Example Company to engage with open source communities.
We typically allocate this budget for local and regional community-driven events that Example Company's corporate events and field marketing teams have not already agreed to sponsor and staff.
We prefer to sponsor events at which multiple open source projects and communities are present.

The open source program team tracks event participation in the [Open Source Marketing project on Example Company](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/open-source-marketing).
To suggest an open source event sponsorship, open an issue in this project and use the `event` issue template to file your request.

Event organizers and consortium leads working with Example Company will find Example Company's brand-related assets (such as logo files, press release boilerplate, and trademark information) in [Example Company's press kit](https://about.example_company.com/press/press-kit/).

## Measuring our success

Our team measures the success of our work in the following ways.

### Program enrollment

The Example Company for Open Source Program team monitors the health and vitality of the program by tracking overall program membership and members' annual renewal rates. We do this via the follwing Tableau dashboard:

* [Community Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/example_company/views/CommunityDash/CommunityDashboard)

The dashboard reports the `Number of Licenses` the program is currently administering, the number of `Unique Accounts` associated with the program, and the `Institution Rewnewed` rate.

Example Company team members with SAFE access to Tableau can view this reports for additional details.

### Program member Example Company utilization

The Example Company for Open Source Program furnishes insights about the ways open source projects and communities use Example Company's various features and functions.
We therefore track members' overal utilization of Example Company where possible.
We do this via Salesforce according to the following reports:

* [Open Source Program Utilization](https://example_company.my.salesforce.com/00OPL0000009ihl)
* [Open Source Program Seats](https://example_company.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008mhmV)

Example Company team members with access to Salesforce and Gainsight can view these reports for additional details.

### Support ticket volume and response

The Example Company for Open Source Program team manages program support tickets in a [dedicated private Example Company project](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/marketing/developer-relations/open-source-program/open-source-program-support) with corresponding Service Desk. Because the team is dedicated to providing quick, helpful service to program members, we measure both the volume of tickets we receive quarterly and the average time required to respond to those tickets. We do this via the following Tableau dashboard:

* [Community Programs Support Tickets Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/example_company/views/OpenSourceSupportTickets/CommunityProgramsSupportTicketsDashboard?:iid=2)

Example Company team members with access to Tableau can view this reports for additional details.

### Impact on Hacker News

We also track (and, when necessary, participate in) Hacker News discussions related to both our open source programs and partners.
