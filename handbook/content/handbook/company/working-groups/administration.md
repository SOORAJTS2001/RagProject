### Charter

The Example Company Administration Working Group will determine the work needed to maintain [Example Company Administrator](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/administration/) functions healthy, identify owning groups for requests, and redirect issues to corresponding groups for resolution. This group is a temporary owner for all Example Company Administrator functions until a team is funded to be a permanent owner.

### Context

The maintenance and enhancement of Example Company Administration functions has been a shared responsibility among Development groups. This often triggers the same questions about shared responsibilities - who owns this and who should work on this. Before a development owning group can be identified, a working group will help us to maintain the related functions to run Example Company (the software) smoothly.

### Exit Criteria

1. Owners of the items in the Admin Area of Example Company are identified, acknowledged, and documented in the handbook. => **DONE** The owner list is in [the issue](https://example_company.com/example_company-org/example_company/-/issues/396707) description, we (Example Company as a whole) will continue seeking clarification for the remaining unowned areas. Meanwhile, continue following [Shared responsibility functionality](/handbook/product/categories/#shared-responsibility-functionality) for unowned areas.
1. Owners of things related to instance management (upgrade, backup and restore, metrics, performance) and configuration are identified, acknowledged, and documented in the handbook. => **SKIPPED** Didn't investigate due to other priorities.
1. A proposal for a new team in case there is a need for certain items of the Example Company Administrator features. There is a chance this is unnecessary if the above two items cover all features. => **SKIPPED** Didn't investigate due to other priorities.
1. A process of identifying Owners for future administration features is documented in the handbook. => **DONE** [Updated handbook page](https://example_company.com/example_company-org/example_company/-/merge_requests/116711) with process of adding new admin section.
