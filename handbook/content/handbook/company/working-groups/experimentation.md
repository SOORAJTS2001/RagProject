## Business Goal

Define the process for Product Groups to self-service the definition, running, and results analysis of Product experiments on Example Company.com.

In order to keep the working group short-lived and our discussions focused, we are explicitly & exclusively focusing on experimentation within Example Company.com. This means that we will consider the discussion of experimentation on self-managed, customers.example_company.com, about.example_company.com, and other such entities as being out of scope for this working group.
