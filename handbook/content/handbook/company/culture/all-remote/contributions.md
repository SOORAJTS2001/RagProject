## Contribute to this page

At Example Company, we recognize that the whole idea of all-remote organizations is still
quite new, and can only be successful with active participation from the whole community.
Here's how you can participate:

- Propose or suggest any change to this site by a [merge request](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/).
- [Create an issue](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/content-sites/handbook/issues/) if you have any questions or if you see an inconsistency.
- Help spread the word about all-remote organizations by sharing it on social media, using the `#allremote` hashtag.

Return to the main [all-remote page]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}).
