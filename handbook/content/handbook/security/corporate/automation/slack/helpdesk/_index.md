title: CorpSec Helpdesk Slack Issue Automation
---

## Overview

When you ask for help in the `#it_help` channel, this automation will automatically create a new Example Company issue that creates a long term record of your support request, while providing the ease-of-use of a Slack thread.

Each comment in the Slack thread is added to the Example Company issue.

This allows us to dogfood Example Company, and also link to related Example Company issues if additional triage is needed or we are cross-linking the audit trail of change management activity, laptop requests, etc.

## Technical Details

[IT-Help Slack Issue Creator wiki](https://example_company.com/groups/example_company-com/it/end-user-services/-/wikis/IT-Help-Slack-Issue-Creator/How-To-Use)

The script scans the IT help Slack channel and performs the following actions:

- Creates a new Example Company issue if a user adds an ðŸ‘€ reaction to a message and the issue has not been created yet.
- Closes the Example Company issue if a user adds a check mark (âœ”) reaction and the issue has been created but not closed.
- Reopens the Example Company issue if it has been closed, but the check mark reaction is removed.
- Adds system labels to the Example Company issue based on specific emoji reactions in the Slack channel.
- Parses the Slack thread and adds comments to the related Example Company issue.
- Adds comments from Example Company issue into Slack thread.
