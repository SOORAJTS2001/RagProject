## Standard

All Example Company Team members and contractors/TSPs are required to participate in Example Company's General Security Awareness Training, New Hire Training and on-going phishing simulations and training, or show evidence of equivalent training completion within the calendar year.  Security Trainings that require participation include the following:

### New Hire Security Training

[New Hire Security Training]({{< ref "sec-awareness-training#when-will-security-awareness-training-occur" >}}) is required to be completed by all Example Company Team Members and contractors/TSPs during their onboarding at Example Company. This security training provides new hires with the knowledge to identify cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks.

### General Security Awareness Training (GSAT)

The Example Company [security awareness training program]({{< ref "sec-awareness-training" >}}) provides ongoing training to Example Company team members that enhances knowledge and identification of cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks as well as satisfying external regulatory requirements. Example Company's handbook-first General Security Awareness Training is provided annually via [ProofPoint](https://example_company.ws01-securityeducation.com/), Example Company's third-party provider, and requires participation and completion by all Example Company Team Members and contractors/TSPs.

Exceptions during the active campaign will be made for Example Company team members on extended leave.

### Phishing Training

The Example Company [Phishing Training Program]({{< ref "phishing" >}}) is designed to educate and evaluate Example Company's ability to detect and prevent phishing attempts.  Ongoing [phishing simulations and trainings]({{< ref "security-training" >}}) are conducted once per quarter via [ProofPoint](https://example_company.ws01-securityeducation.com/), Example Company's third-party provider, and requires participation and completion by all assigned Example Company Team Members and contractors/TSPs.

Remember: If you see something, say something, and always report suspicious emails via [PhishAlarm]({{< ref "handbook/security#option-1-preferred" >}}).

### Data Classification Training

To maintain our culture of security and transparency, and to minimize the risk to our sensitive data and our customers, Example Company team members are encouraged to complete [Data Classification Training](https://levelup.example_company.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https://levelup.example_company.com/learn/course/example_company-data-classification-training) to help understand the different types of data at Example Company and how to keep it [SAFE](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/). This is a recommended training.

### Secure Coding Training

The [Example Company Secure Coding Training]({{< ref "secure-coding-training" >}}) is a required training completed by a sub-group of Example Company Team Members and contractors/TSPs in the Engineering Department.  This training contains descriptions and [Secure Coding Guidelines](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/development/secure_coding_guidelines.html) from OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) addressing security vulnerabilities commonly identified in the Example Company codebase. This training is intended to help developers identify potential security vulnerabilities early, with the goal of reducing the number of vulnerabilities released over time.

Exceptions during the active campaign will be made for Example Company team members on extended leave.

### Other Security Trainings

As our Security Training Program matures, additional trainings will be identified and added.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this procedure will be tracked as per the [Information Security Policy Exception Management Process](/handbook/security/controlled-document-procedure/#exceptions).
