#### Security Testing Tools

When researching security issues, especially those which may compromise the privacy of others, you must use only test accounts in order to respect our users' privacy. Accessing private information of other users, performing actions that may negatively affect Example Company's users (e.g., spam, denial of service). Activity that is disruptive to Example Company operations will result in account being blocked. Examples of disruptive activity include, but are not limited to:

- Generating abusive requests including API requests.
- Mass creation of users, groups, and projects

Disruptive activity such as that listed above can be researched freely on your own installation of Example Company.

- **Testing on Example Company.com**

  When testing on Example Company.com, your @wearehackerone.com address must be associated with the testing example_company.com user account. If
  separate accounts are necessary, you can use an alias. This will help us separate testing from other forms of abuse, and help
  inform the decision of blocking an account. Note that this does not provide immunity, and the Rules of engagement must be followed
  at all times.

  Example Company reporters with 3 or more valid reports are eligible for a 1-year Ultimate license for up to 5 users. As per the
  [H1 policy](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/gl-security/hackerone/configuration/-/blob/master/program-policy.md#example_company-ultimate-license), reporters will request the license through a comment on one of their issues.
