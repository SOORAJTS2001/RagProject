### Example Company team members can reach Trust and Safety via

- Slack: `#abuse` channel using the team Slack handle: `@trust-and-safety`
- Non-urgent queries should be created in our [Operations Tracker](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/gl-security/security-operations/trust-and-safety/operations) or tag us (`@example_company-com/gl-security/security-operations/trust-and-safety`) in the issue and notify us in the `#abuse` slack channel.
- For `URGENT` issues that require the immediate attention of the Trust and Safety team, use the `/security` Slack slash command, the command triggers the `Trust and Safety Escalation Workflow` and requests that you file an incident using a form. The form asks questions about the incident, which will help the Trust and Safety Team automatically determine severity and priority. Depending on which labels get assigned, the Trust and Safety on-call will be paged.

    - *that is or has a high probability of resulting in service degradation or outages of `Example Company.com` and/or its features.*
    - *on `Example Company.com` that has the potential of causing significant legal, financial or reputational damage or liability to the company.*
