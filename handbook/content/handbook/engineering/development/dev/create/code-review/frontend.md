## Engineering Onboarding

### Work

See the [work section](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/code-review/#work) of the main Code Review page.

### Capacity planning

{{% include "includes/engineering/create/weights-fe.md" %}}

### Kickoff & Retrospective Review

On the first week of every milestone, we have a sync-call with every IC in which we review the comments shared in the async retrospective and after that each engineer takes turns at presenting their plan for their Deliverables for the new milestone.

This is scheduled ad-hoc within the first 5-10 days of the milestone.
