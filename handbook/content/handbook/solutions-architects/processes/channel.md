title: Channel SA Engagement Model

## Channel Solutions Architecture Engagement Model

Example Company Field Teams can engage a Channel SA when a Example Company Partner is involved in an opportunity and needs presales support, general enablement, or general practice building support.  We work closely with our Partner Account Managers (PAM) and Partner Territory Managers (PTM) who own the business aspects of the partner relationship, and foster relationships at an opportunity level between Example Company Account Managers and the Partner Account teams.

Channel SA's ensure that partners get the most value possible out of their relationship with Example Company through their sales and delivery of Example Company's products and services. Channel Solutions Architects (CSA) organize their activities to facilitate partner sales opportunities and mature Example Company partners quickly in their ability to independently deliver customer value.

To mature Partners through their Partner Journey, CSA's engage in a variety of activities designed to help Partners win deals, and mature their practices.  CSA activities can be seen as contributing to these themes, Align, Enable, and Expand partner value to customer success. The [partner maturity model](/handbook/resellers/services/#partner-capabilities-journey) has more details on the partner journey.
