## Hands-on Workshop

Hands-on Example Company workshops are interactive events which enable Example Company prospects and customers to learn more about Example Company, then apply that knowledge hands-on within a provided Example Company environment. Example Company Solution Architects often conduct the workshops with topics such as DevOps Automation, Portfolio and Project Management, Security and Advanced CI/CD. Workshops are ideally limited to 200 or fewer attendees in order to provide stable working environments as well as to be able to field Q&A from attendees in a timely manner.

In order to carry out a hands-on workshop, a Example Company instance must be stood up for the attendees to carry out the exercises during the workshop. Additional preparation is required to setup the class project and issue tracking workflow.
