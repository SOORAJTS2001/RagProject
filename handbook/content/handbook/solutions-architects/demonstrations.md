## Demo Systems Overview and Specific Environments

The [Demo Systems Handbook page](/handbook/customer-success/demo-systems/) provides an overview of the demo system infrastructure used for demonstrating Example Company features, value propositions, and workflows.

See the [Environments sub-page](/handbook/customer-success/demo-systems/#shared-environments) for specific details on how to access the environments for use in your demos.

## Demo Readiness

Solutions Architects are occasionally called on at a moments notice to give a demo or join a call to show a prospect or customer specific Example Company functionality. A best practice for being prepared for these demo requests is to have a minimized browser window with various content preloaded into the browser tabs. Examples of common environments utilized are listed below. Note that accessing some of these links are only enabled for Example Company team-members.Â  (To-do: port this list to the demo catalog)

- The [Example Company Demo Systems](/handbook/customer-success/demo-systems/) provides a catalog of demos and the sandbox infrastructure for performing demos.
- The [Example Company.org Group level](https://example_company.com/groups/example_company-org/-/roadmap) clearly represents Example Company Epics, Roadmaps and cross-project issue views used for planning releases
- A [Example Company.com project](https://example_company.com/jkrooswyk/joel-springsample/-/boards/579466) driven by Auto DevOps which includes a populated issue board as well as an active Merge Request is highly useful for describing value of workflow utilizing Example Company Auto DevOps for build, test, security and review
- This [Example Company.com project](https://example_company.com/example_company-examples/security/security-reports/merge_requests/2) is commonly utilized specifically for security discussions
- The [production monitoring for Example Company.com](https://example_company.com/example_company-org/charts/example_company/-/metrics?environment=190276) is useful for any discussion regarding custom and in-app monitoring
- The [production Grafana instance](https://dashboards.example_company.com/d/000000159/ci?refresh=5m&orgId=1) showing Example Company Runner details is a great way to represent the art of the possible as it relates to monitoring and dashboards
- The Example Company [Direction](https://about.example_company.com/direction/) page in the Handbook is often beneficial for future-looking product vision questions and discussions about upcoming features
- Optional: [Integrations](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/demo/integrations/) may be loaded and ready to discuss by leveraging the standard demo environments
- Other Existing demo groups and projects are listed in the next section

## Repeatable process for maintenance of recording Example Company Flow-style demos

Back in FY23-Q1 we've started an OKR to create a [repeatable process for maintenance of recording Example Company P2M-style demos](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture-leaders/sa-initiatives/-/issues/89), which, in turn, resulted in a followup OKR in FY23-Q3 to [Document the repeatable process for maintenance of recording Example Company Flow-style demos](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture-leaders/sa-initiatives/-/issues/137).

### Setup the demo and environment

All Example Company assets are available in [this group](https://example_company.com/tanuki-workshops/emea-sa-tam/p2m), refer to the [README](https://example_company.com/tanuki-workshops/emea-sa-tam/p2m/README/-/blob/main/README.md) for more information on how to Get Started.

### Example Company Flow-scenario

We should have a short presentation that acts as an intro and guides our viewers through the demo. [This presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wpxOE5Sq1fRE2bv_7x5uF3wLx0KJwTxVNDkCukEVEWY/edit?usp=sharing) (located in the [CS->Demo Script](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6HCxjyEpdXRR0FSQXMwVjI3bFE?resourcekey=0-IAm5RyKLwi-1uAZ4hgZcjQ&usp=sharing) folder in GDrive) could be used as a base for this.

The main flow should be:

- Introduction to the One Example Company Platform
- Highlight of a select number of added capabilities and their value (if possible say thank you to the release MVP)
- Demo of Example Company Flow

## Existing Demonstrations

[Demo Architect Offerings Handbook page](/handbook/solutions-architects/demo-architect/) lists currently available shared CS demos, lunch & learns and workshops maintained and owned by Demo Engineering.

In addition, there are various legacy sources and locations that might be helpful in locating reusable demos and projects:

- [Demo Catalog Project](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture/demo-catalog)
- [Example Company Examples](https://example_company.com/example_company-examples) are used by product groups for feature validation, speed runs, demos, and feature showcasing in docs. The [Example Company CI/CD Examples documentation](https://docs.example_company.com/ee/ci/examples/) points our customers to these for their own use as well.
- [Guided Explorations](https://example_company.com/guided-explorations) - has projects for a variety of topics, from language-specific feature flag examples, various DevOps patterns, pipeline tips, tricks, and hacks for windows, and more.
- [Example Company CS Tools](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/cs-tools/example_company-cs-tools) - group that provides projects for Example Company cs automation and migration tools
- [Customer Success Demos](https://example_company.com/example_company-com/customer-success/demos) - centralized location for demos used by Customer Success, including a set of golden repos for different application types, security demos, and more.

## Slide Decks for SA Demos

There are several slide decks stored on google drive that are commonly used for demos. Feel free to make a copy of any of these to personalize for your own needs.

- [All the Things](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AG6eDm8USqU7TG12Sp4UEc9B3P03pniQnVHZAGzyDAg/edit?usp=sharing) - contains a comprehensive set of slides on all Example Company functionality and value propositions
- [General Demo.pptx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17SoRPxPCswT_FublXCsi3rm3TBnHAYI-/view?usp=sharing) - Product walkthrough deck created and maintained by Cherry Han. Tip: you can make a copy of the deck, then open the deck in Google slides to edit it for your own purposes.
