## SaaS tier requirement for SaaS Account and common requests

Unpaid users get limited support [as outlined in the statement of support](https://about.example_company.com/support/statement-of-support/#free-users).
Most of the requests are related to user accounts through the "SaaS Account" ticket form.

The following table is meant to be a helpful quick reference.
However, the sources of truth, in increasing order of priority are:

- [Public Support page](https://about.example_company.com/support/example_company-com-policies)
- [Statement of support page](https://about.example_company.com/support/statement-of-support/#free-users)
- [Individual workflows](index.html#example_company-com)
